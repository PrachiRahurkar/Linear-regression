# Linear-regression
We predict the body weight of an animal using it's brain weight. The model we will use is called Linear Regression. The dataset we are using to train our model is a list of brain weight and body weight measurements, from a bunch of animals. We will fit our line to the data using the scikit learn Machine Learning library, then plot our graph using matplotlib.
